# pickFOURme
I am both really curious and lazy. This pairing provides with lot of enthusiasm to start different project or activities but also a low commitment in the long run.
I am working on it, but in the meantime I try different solution to improve myself. I also happen to love coding and based my whole life on it, so I decided to code a simple random picker to choose what to do when I have some free time. If I am too biased in picking what to do, my PC should be less likely to propose me "easy activities" like playing or chilling at TV. I will try to customize the choice in order to produce funnier and targetized results.

**CUSTOM RULE: Right now it is Sep 13th, 2021, 20.49. I will start coding at 21:00 and willing to finish before 23:00. We'll see what will happen**

## Curiosities
- In some days I will attend to a concert, an Italian rapper named Ernia. In these minutes before 21:00 I will do a nice playlist to listen to.
- I ended the job in ~75 min, 45 min less then predicted. It was not an hard task, but considering that is more then a month that i don't *python* and I had to refresh a little, I am pretty happy.
- After listening to Ernia i opted the great podcast of Alessandro Barbero on the murder of famous politician Aldo Moro, from extreme left armed groups.
- The result is quite useless, but as always it was fun to program.
